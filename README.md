# Run Locally

Use the `run.sh` script to set up the rust server for generating shaders and NextJS frontend for serving/running shaders.

# Build a static frontend site

Navigate to the `frontend` directory. Ensure your `.env` files are set up with the url base path you'd like to run from.

Run `npm run export` to build the static site, then zip it up and send it over to the server
